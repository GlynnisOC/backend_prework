## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
Purpose of a method is so you don't have to type the same code or word repeatedly.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(dr)
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello(dr)

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone(name)
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I'm not sure that I have questions, but will be studying the in's and out's of methods as I'm currently struggling with the terminology within them. The site we read from is great in laying it out, but I'm more of a kinesthetic learner, so I know I will need to make flashcards or something of the sort.
