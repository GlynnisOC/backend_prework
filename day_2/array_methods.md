1. Sort method is used when comparing elements in the array to one another. The result
is not guaranteed to be stable.
2. Each method takes a list as its first argument and a block as its second argument.
For each element included in the list, the each method runs the block passing
it the current element as a parameter.
3. Join method takes all the elements included in a list and combines them into
one string.
4. Include method searches for if an element is present in an array or not and
when working with it, if the element is not present, terminal returns an error
about wrong number of arguments.
5. Collect method takes each element and places them into a new array that gets
returned. It essentially morphs one array into another.
6. First method returns the first element in an array, while last method returns the last
element in an array. You are able to return two or more elements at a time if
a number is included in parentheses after either first or last.
7. Shuffle method simply shuffles the elements within the array. You are able to
have the elements returned to their correct order as well.
